## Devops Day 9  Git and GitHub | What is GIT ? | What is Version Control ?

**Git** is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel but has since been adopted by many other projects. Git is free and open-source software.

Here's a breakdown of what Git is and some of its key features:

1. **Version Control System**: Git is a version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in files and allows multiple people to collaborate on projects. It keeps track of every modification to the codebase, enabling developers to revert back to previous versions if necessary.

2. **Distributed**: Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that every developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine. This allows for offline work and faster access to version history.

3. **Branching and Merging**: Git provides powerful branching and merging capabilities. Developers can create separate branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be easily merged back into the main branch (typically `master` or `main`) once changes are complete.

4. **Lightweight**: Git is lightweight and fast, making it suitable for both small and large projects. It stores changes as snapshots of the entire repository, rather than as individual file differences, which contributes to its speed and efficiency.

5. **Secure**: Git ensures the integrity of your code by using cryptographic hashes to uniquely identify each commit. This helps prevent tampering with the version history.

6. **Open Source**: Git is open-source software, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

**Version Control**:

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It is commonly used in software development to manage source code, but it can also be used for documents, configuration files, and other types of files. Version control systems provide several benefits, including:

1. **History Tracking**: Version control systems keep a detailed history of changes made to files, including who made the changes and when. This allows developers to understand the evolution of the codebase and revert to previous versions if necessary.

2. **Collaboration**: Version control systems enable multiple developers to work on the same files simultaneously. They provide mechanisms for merging changes made by different developers and resolving conflicts that arise.

3. **Branching and Forking**: Version control systems support branching, which allows developers to create separate lines of development for new features or experiments. Forking, a form of branching used in distributed version control systems, allows developers to create independent copies of a repository.

4. **Backup and Recovery**: Version control systems serve as a backup mechanism for code and other files. If a file is accidentally deleted or corrupted, it can usually be recovered from the version control system.
